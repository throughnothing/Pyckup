Pyckup
==========
Pyckup aims to be an efficient, secure, and easy-to-use backup system based around many of the ideas used in brackup.

Goals
=========
It will support ftp,scp,amazon s3, rackspace cloud files, and possibly (hopefully) others.

Pyckup will have sources and targets.  Users can have multiple sources and targets.  

Pyckup will be chunk and data based, meaning that it will not care about file names or file paths (but will keep track of where things go for restoration).  Each chunk will be stored on the server only once (even if the chunk appears multiple times in the source) to save space if files or parts of files exist multiple times.

Files and folders can be freely moved around in a source path, and Pyckup will only have to backup meta-data to record the new location of the chunks that already exist on the server.
